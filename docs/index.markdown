# 3D CCDIK Simulation and Flocking and Pathing Simulation - Caleb Wiebolt

Below is the write-up for my CCD IK Project which also includes a separate Flocking simulation that used BOIDS and extends the algorithm to incorperate collision avoicdance in order to simualte a basic goal based pathing system as well. It was created in Unity for my Animation and Planning in Games class. All the graded features that I attempted can be found below. To look at the source code or a pre-built executable click the button below.

### Feature List

| Feature                           | Description       | TimeCode |
|:-------------                     |:------------------|:------|
| Multi Arm IK          | My IK has two arms connected together part way through the armiture and rooted at a singular point. | X:XX-X:XX  |
| Joint Limits       | Arbitrary joints on the arimture can be constrainted to rotating around a specific axis and restricting that rotation to a specific range of angles. | X:XX-X:XX   |
| 3D Simualtion  | The IK Simulation is done in 3D. | X:XX-X:XX |
| 3D Rendering & Camera | Both simulation are rendered in 3D with textures, lighting, and a controllable 3D Camera. | X:XX-X:XX |
| Flocking   | I implemented the BOIDS algorithm to simulate flocking behavipr between agents. | X:XX-X:XX   |
| Single Agent Navigation   | I extended the BOIDS architecture adding collisioin avoidance and steering behavior towards a selectable goal allowing agents to naviaget through a complex enviroment to a specific goal. | X:XX-X:XX   |
